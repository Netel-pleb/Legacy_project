Welcome to Domain-Driven Design: Working with Legacy Projects
=====================

This is the source code for my Pluralsight course Domain-Driven Design: Working with Legacy Projects (link is coming soon).

How to Get Started
--------------

There are 3 versions of the source code: Initial, ACL, and SyncACL. Initial contains the legacy code base as is. In ACL, you can find the code with the Anticorruption Layer from Module 3. SyncACL contains the code from Module 4 with Synchronizing Anticorruption Layer.

In order to run the application, you need to create a database and change the connection string in the composition root.
